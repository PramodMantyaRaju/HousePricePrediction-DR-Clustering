Dimension Reduction and Clustering Analysis - Housing Price Prediction

**Introduction and Goal:**
Welcome to the Dimension Reduction and Clustering Analysis project for housing price prediction. The main goal of this project is to explore advanced techniques in dimension reduction and clustering to enhance the predictive modeling of housing prices. By leveraging Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) for categorical data and Gower distance for clustering, we aim to improve the accuracy and interpretability of our predictive models.

**Data Details:**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and comprises housing data with both numerical and categorical features. It has been preprocessed to handle missing values and contains predictors related to housing attributes. This dataset serves as a practical case study to apply dimension reduction and clustering techniques in real-world scenarios.

**Analysis:**
Dimension reduction techniques such as MCA and PCA are applied to handle categorical and numerical features, respectively. By reducing dimensionality while preserving essential information, we aim to improve model efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, clustering analysis using Gower distance and K-medoids clustering provides insights into inherent data patterns, aiding in understanding customer preferences and behavior.

**Highlights:**

1. Advanced Techniques Application:
   Utilizing advanced dimension reduction methods like MCA alongside traditional techniques such as PCA allows for a comprehensive analysis of mixed data types.

2. Robust Clustering Analysis:
   Employing the Gower distance metric and K-medoids clustering enables the identification of meaningful clusters within the dataset, enhancing segmentation and targeting strategies.

3. Interpretability and Insights:
   By exploring associations and patterns in the data, we gain valuable insights into housing market trends, which can inform strategic decision-making processes and drive business growth.

**Report and Code:**
Detailed findings and analysis are documented in the Jupyter Notebook file named "Housing_Price_Prediction_Dimension_Reduction_Clustering.ipynb". The repository also contains relevant code and scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis and results effectively.
